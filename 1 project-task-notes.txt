These are my notes on the project task page. This project is called "Build a Celestial Bodies Database." The URL for the page which these notes are on is https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/build-a-celestial-bodies-database-project/build-a-celestial-bodies-database 

- Building a database of celestial bodies using PostgreSQL
	-> The previous guided project in the course was building a PostgreSQL database
	-> This is similar in the sense that we are building a database, but we already have the benefit of being introduced to the course material 
	-> The notes from the previous guided project 

- Running the guided project
	-> It's completed in VSCode in the browser, in a Gitpod environment 
	-> Open the command palette, and enter `CodeRoad: Start`
	-> Then complete the guided project 
		-> There are user stories which are described in it 
		-> You need to pass all the tests in it, past step 1
		-> Part of completing this is saving the database you make while you complete the guided project 
		-> This will prompt you to save the database as a universe.sql file 
		-> When you complete the guided project, you need to be logged into the freeCodeCamp website in one tab - and then to complete the guided project in the other tab 
		-> Once a certain level of progress has been made in one tab, the other one will log this 
	-> Completing the project gives you files 
	-> You upload those files to GitHub
	-> Then you submit a link to the repository with those files
	-> They want a universe.sql file <- this is the one which is exported when you complete the guided project  

Important points:
	-> Take the notes from the previous guided project, and use them to help you with this -> it's making a similar database 
	-> It's in a Gitpod environment -> CodeRoad: Start in the command palette
	-> Have both tabs open when you complete the guided project or the progress might not be saved
	-> Take the outputted file from completing the project, push it to GitHub and submit the link to its repository 

-> It's the same as the previous course, except that the situation where the skills are being applied is different 
-> And this time we are submitting a link when it's done -> which they will prompt you into 
-> So you complete this course, as with the previous course, and refer back to the notes you made when you did the previous course
