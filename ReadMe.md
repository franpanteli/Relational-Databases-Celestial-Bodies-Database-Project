# Relational-Databases-Celestial-Bodies-Database-Project
I independently completed [the third project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/build-a-celestial-bodies-database-project/build-a-celestial-bodies-database) in freeCodeCamp's [Relational Databases course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/), to improve my PostgreSQL skills. This curriculum consisted of 14 guided project courses to be completed in a Gitpod environment and increasing in complexity. My notes outlining the names (et al) of these guided courses are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Celestial-Bodies-Database-Project/blob/main/0%20relational-databases-course-overview.txt). This repository is for the third project I completed as part of this course. For this, I had to produce a relational database of celestial bodies, populated with sample data.  My notes on the full task brief for this are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Celestial-Bodies-Database-Project/blob/main/1%20project-task-notes.txt). To complete this, I cloned the project boilerplate files in a Gitpod environment and created a relational database which satisfied its success criteria. I exported these success criteria from the project Linux VM as a PDF and annotated this with my problem-solving thought processes [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Celestial-Bodies-Database-Project/blob/main/3%20Celestial%20Bodies%20Database%20-%20Instructions.pdf). I used the [notes I produced from the previous guided project in the course](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Mario-Database-Project/blob/main/2%20relational-databases-Mario-database-guided-course-notes.txt) as a reference resource when doing this. I also created notes on some of the decisions I made when creating this new database in a separate file [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Celestial-Bodies-Database-Project/blob/main/2%20relational-databases-celestial-bodies-guided-course-notes.txt). The `universe.sql` database produced after executing a database dump for this is [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Celestial-Bodies-Database-Project/blob/main/universe.sql).
